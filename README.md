# Original Repo

[Nuxt 3 Library Consumption Test](https://github.com/dcrall/nuxt-lib-consumption).

# Context

I needed a simple repository to run tests.

- **vite-test-lib** - A minimal Vite library using Vue 3. It is published at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prp-astara/vite-vue3-test-lib.
- **nuxt3-lib-consumer** - A minimal Nuxt 3 application.
- **vite-lib-consumer** - A minimal Vite app that consumes the library. Very similar configuration to the Nuxt app. This works correctly in dev & prod.
